# AI_vs_Stats
In this project, my aim is to learn about and write my own simple AI model for value prediction, and compare the outcomes to traditional statistical methods.

My idea (as of the time of creating this repository), is to create a model that is trained on (n-1) periods of data, on a dataset of n periods. Then, I will check its outcome for the nth year. I will compare this outcomes by basic iterative statistical methods. Finally, I will backtest the model's predictions with actual data from the nth time step and visualize the outcomes.
